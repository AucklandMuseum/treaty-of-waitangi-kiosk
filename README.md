# The Treaty of Waitangi exhibit

The Treaty of Waitangi exhibit, situated in the Māori Court, provides an insight into the history of the Treaty from multiple perspectives. It touches on the ongoing Treaty of Waitangi Settlement Process including the work of the Waitangi Tribunal.
 
The onsite exhibit is supported by an in-gallery (this package) and online digital story, which brings contemporary voices and personal stories to life, and highlighs differing perspectives relating to the Treaty with a focus on iwi from Tāmaki Makaurau. Perspectives from the Treaty partners are all considered.
 
Visitors can see a copy of the Treaty document, and read text versions, including  Professor Sir Hugh Kawharu’s English translation of the Māori text.
 
A map element illustrates the changes in land ownership since the signing of the Treaty to today, and shows where the Treaty was signed right here in Tāmaki Makaurau.
 
This digital story features films that have been especially commissioned by Auckland Museum, to reveal the various perspectives about the Treaty and the process of Treaty Settlement. Among other things, visitors will have an opportunity to understand the history and be able to place the financial Settlement in the context of the hurt and wrong that the Crown acknowledges.
